# Riverflow 2.0 Best Practices

Use this skill to craft higher-reliability prompts and production-ready creative workflows for Riverflow 2.0.

## Quick start

1. Choose the mode: t2i, i2i, or refSR.
2. Write a single, clear instruction with the primary subject and outcome.
3. Add structured constraints (layout, typography, lighting, product details).
4. If using fonts, provide `fontInputs` and quote the exact copy in the instruction.
5. For refSR, provide 1–4 high-quality reference images and describe the exact detail to preserve.

## Core workflow cues

- Lead with the core subject and outcome; keep the first sentence unambiguous.
- Use concrete, verifiable details (colors, materials, layout, camera/lighting).
- For edits, explicitly state what to keep vs change.
- Keep typography instructions explicit: font name + exact text + placement.
