# Reference-based super resolution (refSR)

Use refSR to repair fine product details or typography at 2K/4K by providing high-quality references.

## Guidance

- Provide 1–4 reference images that show the correct detail.
- refSR does not use a prompt or instruction; rely on the references to convey the target detail.
- Use clean, well-lit reference imagery with minimal compression.

## Common uses

- Product label corrections
- Fine text/logo repair
- Packaging artwork restoration
