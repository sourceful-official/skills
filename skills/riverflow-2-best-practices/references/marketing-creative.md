# Marketing asset patterns

## Hero image

Use a structured layout and reserve negative space for copy:

```
A hero banner featuring the product centered, with clean negative space in the top-right
for headline text. Soft studio lighting, high contrast, premium feel.
```

## Social square

```
A square social post with the product centered and a subtle gradient background.
Include a short headline at the top and a CTA at the bottom.
```

## Brand consistency

- Specify brand colors using hex codes.
- Define background style (solid, gradient, textured).
- Specify the framing (tight product shot, medium, or wide).

## Composition cues

- "Centered product with 15% padding on all sides"
- "Top-aligned headline, bottom-aligned CTA"
- "Rule of thirds: product on left, copy on right"
