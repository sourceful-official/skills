# Prompt structure

Use a single instruction sentence that covers subject, action, and outcome, then add constraints.

Recommended structure:

```
[Primary subject] + [Action or change] + [Outcome]
[Layout] + [Lighting] + [Materials] + [Background] + [Camera]
[Brand/typography constraints]
```

## High-signal patterns

- "A clean product shot of [product] on [background], with [lighting], [material detail]."
- "A hero banner featuring [product] centered, with negative space top-right for copy."
- "Edit the image by [change], keeping [elements] unchanged."

## Clarity rules

- Prefer concrete nouns and measurable details.
- Replace vague terms ("nice", "premium") with specific cues ("matte black aluminum", "softbox key light").
- Avoid compound, conflicting adjectives in the same clause.

## Example

```
Generate a clean product shot of a matte black perfume bottle on a white seamless background.
Use softbox lighting with a subtle rim light on the left, and a gentle drop shadow.
```
