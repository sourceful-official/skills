# Riverflow 2.0 launch partners (API)

Use this skill to guide integrations via approved launch partners. Each partner owns the API surface and authentication.

Last updated: 2026-02-03

## Quick start

1. Ask which partner the user is integrating with.
2. Link to the partner docs for setup, auth, and request formats.
3. For Sourceful-specific prompting or creative guidance, use `riverflow-2-best-practices`.

## Partner docs

- Runware: https://runware.ai/docs/providers/sourceful
- OpenRouter: https://openrouter.ai/sourceful
- Replicate: https://replicate.com/sourceful

## Notes

- If someone needs implementation details beyond the partner docs, ask them to share the partner docs excerpt or their request payload.

## Reference

- `references/partners.md` for the canonical doc links.
